# README #

This tool requires a version of g++ with support for C++11.

This distribution includes a modified version of the Open-WBO MaxSAT solver, which compiles together with the synthesis tool. See the open-wbo subdirectory for details.

To compile, simply run `make` from the top level.

Run as `./bafsyn in.qdimacs`, where `in.qdimacs` is a QDIMACS file of the form forall-exists.
